*** Description
These international meetings aim at bringing in contact people working on various aspects of the Theory of Quantum Integrable Systems. Applications of Integrable Systems, such as string/gauge theories, condensed matter physics or statistical physics are also emphasized.
The RAQIS' meetings occur roughly every two years. The first ones were held in LAPTh, Annecy-le-Vieux, in March 2003 (See RAQIS'03), September 2005 (See RAQIS'05), September 2007 (See RAQIS'07) and June 2010 (See RAQIS'10). In September 2012, it was held in Angers (co-organized with LAREMA), see RAQIS'12. In September 2014, the RAQIS'14 conference (co-organized with IMB) took place in Dijon. In August 2016, the RAQIS'16 conference was held in Geneva (co-organized with the University of Geneva).
